# 4chan-userscripts
## Future Developement
	Combine all into one master script rellying entirely on a well functioning and bug free 4chanX API.
## About The Features
Repository of ECHibiki's 4chan userscripts.<br/>
Most all of these scripts expand upon 4chanX's quick reply feature and require it.

### Danbooru Image Adder
#### Adds images to your posts
Adds an image to your post taken from the danbooru's image collection.<br/>
Supply it with tags via an autocomplete, set the rating(s/q/e) and it will give an image for you to post with. 

### Kita-Yen
#### Color text
Converts the colors of special symbols from plain black into other prettier colors(yen == purple, kita == dark grey).<br/>
#### Hotkeys for Convinience
<strong>Press ctrl+\ for ¥</strong>
Highlights the whole line in purple much like how greentext works<br/>
<strong>Press ctrl+k for ｷﾀ━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━!!</strong>
Highlights just the word in dark gray<br/>

### 4chan-Ignoring-Enhancements
#### Hides images.
Gives the ability to hide images with ctrl+shift+click. Stores in browser memory for new sessions.<br/>
#### Word Filters
Also includes the ability to do word replacements with a regex replacement system.<br>

### Thread Rebuilder
#### Rebuild dead threads from scratch
Rebuild a thread from 4chan's archive.<br/>
Simple system that could use some additions(using 4chan's offsite archives for example)

### Visible Password
#### Shows your 4chan post/delete password
* Displays your 4chan password in an inputbox.
* Top left is the post password, Bottom right is the delete password.
* Edit the input boxes to change them.

__Note:__ some 4chan boards don't allow custom post passwords. May require cookie manipulation, but this has not yet been tested...
